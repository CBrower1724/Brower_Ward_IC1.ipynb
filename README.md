From this first in class assignment we found a wikepedia page regarding the 2024 Summer Olympic games and web scrapped an image, a table, and a paragraph from the page to our jupyter notebook. The image was a swimmer who won many gold medals and was very sucessful in this years olympic games. The table was the top countries based off of gold, silver, bronze, and total medal count. This table showed which countries won the most and were the best in this years olympics. The paragraph was basic information about the olympics based off of location, the dates, the number of events, and much more. This webpage was very informal and interesting but also challenging to web scrap from.
